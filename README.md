Interactive app(s) for showing fireworks using [Flutter]'s canvas.

## Repo structure

To allow for both the [live demo] and counter app using the same code for rendering the actual
fireworks, the repo contains the following packages:

* [`fireworks`][fireworks], which is a basic Flutter **package** that contains a
  [render object and widget](https://youtu.be/HqXNGawzSbY) for rendering the fireworks. It also
  contains a controller class that manages the rockets, explosion particles, vsync, etc.
* [`fireworks_demo`][fireworks_demo], which is the app that is used for the [live demo].
* [`fireworks_counter`][fireworks_counter], which is a slightly modified version of the Flutter
  template app using the `fireworks` package. 

## Live demo

You can view a [live demo] of the `fireworks` package in action that allows you to both watch the
fireworks and launch your own firework rockets by hovering with the mouse :)

I made about it. 

## Counter app

For the Flutter counter challenge, I took the template app that is generated by `flutter create`
and modified just a few lines of code to add the fireworks to it :)

Because I had already implemented the `fireworks` package in an abstract way before, I was able
to simply drop the widget and the controller into the counter app and transform it in a matter of
minutes.
